Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning:
Remove stop words, special characters, and irrelevant text.
Normalize text (e.g., convert to lowercase).
Tokenization: Break sentences into words for easier analysis.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Convert words to their base forms.
Noise Removal: Exclude irrelevant posts using filters (e.g., keyword matching for stock symbols).
